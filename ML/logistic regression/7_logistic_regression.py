<h2 style="color:green" align="center">Predicting if a person would buy life insurnace based on his age using logistic regression</h2>

Above is a binary logistic regression problem as there are only two possible outcomes (i.e. if person buys insurance or he/she doesn't).

<h2 style="color:purple">Exercise</h2>

Consider the employee retention dataset 
1. Now do some exploratory data analysis to figure out which variables have direct and clear impact on employee retention (i.e. whether they leave the company or continue to work)
2. Plot bar charts showing impact of employee salaries on retention
3. Plot bar charts showing corelation between department and employee retention
4. Now build logistic regression model using variables that were narrowed down in step 1
5. Measure the accuracy of the model
